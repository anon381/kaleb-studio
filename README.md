# Next.js Project

This is a Next.js 16 project scaffolded with TypeScript and Tailwind.

## Getting started

Install dependencies (uses pnpm):

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Scripts

- pnpm dev — Run development server
- pnpm build — Build for production
- pnpm start — Start production server
- pnpm lint — Run ESLint
- pnpm format — Run Prettier
- pnpm test — Run unit tests (Vitest)

## Notes

- ESLint config added at `.eslintrc.json`.
- Basic Vitest setup is expected; install dev dependencies as listed in package.json.
